# ðŸ’« About Me:
I am Ankit Belbase currently enrolled in Computer Science inPulchowk Campus . I have been coding for more than three years, and my areas of expertise are  machine learning, and deep learning. I have a strong desire to create applications that are impactful, scalable, and intelligent.
Deep learning frameworks, computer vision, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Spring Boot, Vue.js, and different database technologies are all part of my technical toolkit. I have a strong background in computer vision and deep learning, having worked with both traditional and contemporary methods and possessing a solid theoretical understanding. I like working on projects of all kinds, from creating user-friendly frontends to creating reliable backend systems and creating complex AI models.
 My interests span physics and mathematics, and I'm currently delving into reinforcement learning and physics-informed neural networks, exploring how physical laws can be embedded into machine learning models.

# My Key Works
### DeepFit - Virtual-Tryon
Built a system where user can tryon diffrent clothes available online on ecommerce sites . This was built on the top of stable diffusion-2 using **cuda** , **Pytorch** and **Javascript**.

### AI Mobile Assistant 
Built an mobile assistant app leveraging **flutter** , **dart** , inspired from google voice assistant where user can manage different settings of mobile like Volume and Brightness control , Switching over applications , Chatting with LLM and many more. 

### 8085 microprocessor simulator
Developed a web-based simulator where student can experiment with 8085 instructions in hex as well as assembly language . Techstack used : **Javascript** , **dotnet** .

### LLM driven Lecture Optimization
Developed an system for adaptive lecture videos that automatically adjust playback speed based on content difficulty. The system transcribes lecture audio using **WhisperX** for indentifying attention in audio.

Excited to continue developing as a software engineer and contribute to difficult projects in rapidly changing field of Computer Science.
